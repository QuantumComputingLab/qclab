# QCLAB Matlab Toolbox [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5160554.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5160554)

QCLAB is an object-oriented MATLAB toolbox for creating, representing and simulating
quantum circuits. QCLAB can be used for rapid prototyping and testing of
quantum algorithms, and allows for fast algorithm development and discovery.
QCLAB provides I/O through openQASM making it compatible with quantum hardware.
Furthermore, QCLAB can draw circuit diagrams to the MATLAB command window
and save the circuit diagrams to LaTeX source files. Please refer to the 
`examples/` directory for example use cases.

### How to run? ###

The QCLAB Toolbox is implemented using MATLAB object oriented functionalities
and is compatible with MATLAB R2020b or newer.

1. Clone repository:

        git clone https://github.com/QuantumComputingLab/qclab.git

2. Add all files from qclab directory to MATLAB path to install QCLAB:

		addpath(qclabroot);
		savepath;

3. Run tests in MATLAB:
		
		cd test/
		runTests.m
 
4. Generate documentation with doxygen. Requires [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) and [doxymatlab](https://github.com/simgunz/doxymatlab). Adjust tags `FILTER_PATTERNS` and `FILTER_SOURCE_PATTERNS`  in `doxygen/Doxyfile.dox` to local `m2cpp.pl` script.
	
		cd doc/doxygen/
		doxygen Doxyfile.dox
